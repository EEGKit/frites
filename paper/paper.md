# Summary

Brain activity is consistently changing but reproducible perturbations can be
triggered either by external stimuli, repetitive behavior or can even be present
in absence of any stimulation. The field of computational neuroscience aims to
extract and quantify emerging patterns occurring during cognition, understand
how information is locally processed such as how brain regions coordinate.
That said, approaching the brain as a deeply connected network drastically
increase the complexity of statistical analyses. Over and above, identifying
task-related activity in the context of noisy measurements and therefore, a poor
signal-to-noise ratio is a real challenge. This situation justify the use of
powerful statistical approaches linking neurophysiological data to an external
variable combined to sophisticated group-level statistics to extract brain activity
modulated by the task and reproducible across a population or overall, repeated
measurements.
